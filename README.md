## Overview

This project connects to the CancerModels.org API to retrieve, process, and visualize expression and mutation data for cancer research. The goal is to facilitate exploratory data analysis and support researchers in understanding the molecular characteristics of various cancer models.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch expression and mutation data directly from CancerModels.org API.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize gene expression patterns, mutation frequencies, and other insights.
  
## Requirements

- **Python** 3.8 or higher
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries**:
  - `requests` for API data retrieval
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and/or `seaborn` for data visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cancer-models-analysis.git
   cd cancer-models-analysis
2. Install the required libraries
3. Run jupyter notebook
   
## Usage
